    <h1>COVID-19 Vaccines</h1>
    
<p> Getting a COVID-19 vaccine helps to lower your chances of getting COVID-19, spreading it to others, and ending up in the hospital. The district is partnering with local organizations to provide COVID-19 vaccine opportunities to students, staff, families, and the community. Staying up-to-day with your COVID vaccines is strongly encouraged. You can view our vaccine clinic opportunities on our COVID-19 Vaccine Information page. </p>

<h1> COVID-19 Rapid Testing </h1>
    
<p>Families can get a COVID-19 test for any reason at one of our testing hubs or community sites. Days, times and locations can be found on our COVID-19 Testing Information page.

COVID-19 rapid antigen testing will be available in campus health rooms. </p>

<h1>Masks</h1>
<p>Masks are optional in Austin ISD.

Face masks can be provided for any student, staff, or visitor who requests one.

Masks continue to be an effective way of preventing the spread of COVID-19 for those who choose to wear them.

Please keep in mind that the fluidity of this pandemic may require that we reinstate a masking requirement. </p>

<h1>Screening </h1>
<p>We strongly encourage all individuals to screen for symptoms per CDC guidelines before coming to campus.

Anyone who is sick should stay home and contact their campus immediately. </p>

<h1>Sick Individuals</h1>
<p>If you’re feeling sick
If you or your child are feeling sick, regardless of whether you are vaccinated or not, please stay home and contact your medical provider and campus as soon as possible.</p>

<h1>If you test positive</h1>
<p>Those who test positive will need to stay home and report their case by calling the school’s front office and asking for the COVID-19 designee. Staff should report the COVID-19 positive result to their supervisor. </p>

<h1> Returning to school </h1>
<p> After testing positive, you need to wait five days before returning to school (the day you tested positive is Day 0). Anyone who tested positive will need markedly improved symptoms and to be fever-free for 24 hours before returning.

Students or staff who return to campus on the sixth day after a positive result will be required to mask for five more calendar days. </p>

<h1> Cleaning </h1>
<p> We’re cleaning and disinfecting our classrooms and buses daily. Hand sanitizer and hand washing stations are easily found in our hallways. Students are encouraged to wash hands frequently. </p>

<h2> Questions </h2>
<p>If you have any questions, please reach out through Let’s Talk.

Please note that while we do not expect many or any changes to the above protocols, we will continue to adjust protocols and communicate any changes as new governmental mandates and health authority recommendations are given. </p>
